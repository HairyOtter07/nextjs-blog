Hey there! I'm HairyOtter07, and this is my first post! This is a simple blog written with the official [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn), but you looked at the home page, you already know that.

Here's a little bit about myself: My favorite video game is [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/), and I'm active in the speedrunning community for BotW (even though I only have one submitted run).  

I also absolutely love programming, and the languages I know ('know' meaning 'know well enough to code something cool') are  
* Python
* JavaScript (and Node.JS)
* HTML/CSS (not really programming)
* Java

And the languages I'm working on learning are  
* C/C++
* Rust
* React (specifically Next.js, hence this website)

That's all for now, look around the site and enjoy!
