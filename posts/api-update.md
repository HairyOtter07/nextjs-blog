Hey, it's me again. Today, I figured I wanted to make the API even cooler, so I decided to add another route, namely `/api/posts/`.

As you might be able to guess, this returns an array of all posts, where each post object matches the format of `/api/posts/[id]`. In fact, that's how I implemented it, by calling my own API route.

If you want a refresher on the format, check out the first tutorial post, from yesterday.

That's all for today, so this is HairyOtter07, signing off!
